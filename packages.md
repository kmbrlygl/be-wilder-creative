I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

1. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
2. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
3. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

## You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. __What could possibly go wrong?__ *I hate yogurt.* It's just stuff with bits in.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

## *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Saving the world with meals on wheels. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

* I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
* You've swallowed a planet!
* It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

It's just stuff with bits in. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
